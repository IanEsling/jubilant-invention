# jubilant-invention

This is a Java CLI application using Maven and Java 11. 

The application can be run from the command line from the project root using `java -jar ford.jar` or you can build it from scratch using `mvn clean package` which will create the runnable jar `target/ford-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Alternatively it can be run from an IDE using the `HenrysGrocery` class as the entrypoint.

Usage and available commands are displayed in the console when it starts.
